In terms of not being complient with the requirements: I`ve two issues, the first one was the linter, i couldnt import it and i couldnt finish the tests for this implementation due time.

In the solution i`ve tried to work with the ec6 using the "type": "module" for import, for the new structure of imports.
the project was created from scratch using moment,jwt-simple,node-fetch,express and ejs for views(only one that shows if theres any path not that is not complain)
